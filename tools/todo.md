- The Agent with its main loop might become a class
- the print will be abstracted and injected (then we can have a subagent be indented or prefixed)
- add subagent tool that reuses the agent class and its loop
- a subagent ends with a summary and returns that
- a subagent might have its own tool library and system prompt
