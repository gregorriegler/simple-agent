# Circular Dependency Report

## Problem
The project has a circular dependency in the agent and tools modules.

## Dependency Chain
```
Agent (application/agent.py)
  ↓ uses
ToolLibrary (tools/tool_library.py)
  ↓ imports
SubagentTool (tools/subagent_tool.py)
  ↓ imports (line 47)
Agent (application/agent.py)
  ↓ CIRCULAR!
```

## Details

### agent.py
- Uses `ToolLibrary` as a dependency (passed in constructor)
- Agent needs tools to execute commands

### tool_library.py
- Imports and instantiates `SubagentTool` (line 16, 53)
- Creates all tools in `_create_static_tools()` method

### subagent_tool.py  
- Imports `Agent` inside the `execute()` method (line 47)
- Uses Agent to create a sub-agent for nested task execution

## Current State
The circular dependency is **partially mitigated** by using a lazy import:
- `SubagentTool` imports `Agent` inside the `execute()` method (line 47)
- This delays the import until runtime, avoiding import-time circular dependency
- Python modules can be imported successfully without errors
- All tests pass (82/82)

## Analysis

### Why the Circular Dependency Exists
The circular dependency is inherent to the design:
- `Agent` orchestrates tool execution
- `SubagentTool` needs to create new `Agent` instances for nested execution
- This creates a conceptual cycle at the domain level

### Current Solution: Lazy Import
The code uses **lazy importing** (import inside method) which:
✅ Prevents import-time errors
✅ Keeps the code working
⚠️ Is a workaround rather than a proper architectural solution

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Agent Factory (Recommended)
Create an `AgentFactory` that `SubagentTool` can use:
- `SubagentTool` depends on `AgentFactory` instead of `Agent`
- `AgentFactory` knows how to construct `Agent` instances
- Breaks the circular dependency at the import level

### Option 2: Callback Pattern
Pass an agent creation callback to `SubagentTool`:
- `ToolLibrary` provides a factory function to `SubagentTool`
- `SubagentTool` calls the factory when it needs to create subagents
- More flexible but adds complexity

### Option 3: Keep Current (Pragmatic)
The lazy import is working fine:
- Tests pass
- No runtime issues
- Code is clear about the dependency
- Python handles it gracefully

## Recommendation
**Keep the current lazy import approach** for now because:
1. It works correctly (all tests pass)
2. The circular dependency is at the domain level (inherent to the design)
3. Refactoring would add complexity without clear benefits
4. If the codebase grows, revisit with Option 1 (Agent Factory)

**Status**: ✅ Working as intended - no immediate action required

However, this is still a circular dependency at the conceptual/runtime level.

## Solution
The lazy import (importing inside the method) is actually the correct pattern here and breaks the import-time circular dependency. The code is working as intended.

**Status**: ✅ No action needed - the circular dependency is already properly handled with lazy importing.
