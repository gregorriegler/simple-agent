# Simple Task

Intent: Work on a small task making sure the tests keep passing, and we don't accidentally add unwanted changes. 

1. Make sure the `git status` is clean and shows no changes
2. Make sure the tests pass before we start. Run `test.sh`.
3. Execute the given Task.
4. Make sure the tests pass again afterwards.
5. Ask me to commit.
