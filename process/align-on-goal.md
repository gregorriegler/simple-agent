STARTER_SYMBOL=ðŸ’¡

ASK ONE QUESTION AT A TIME

1. Archive the old `goal.md` if exists by moving it to `<expressive-name>-goal.md`
2. Read the `README.md`
3. Analyze the goal and tell me what you understood briefly
4. Ask questions about the goal if something is not clear
  - before you ask notify me using say.py
5. Iterate with me on the goal until we are aligned
6. Save the goal in a new `goal.md` file
7. Ask me to review the `goal.md` so I can make final changes.
8. commit the changes. start your commit message with "d ", e.g. "d aligned on goal bla bla bla"
9. Delegate using a fresh context so it reads and follows the `process/planning-process.md` instructions.
