# Refactoring Process

STARTER_SYMBOL=🧹

Refactoring means to improve the structure of the code in tiny steps while maintaining its current observable behavior. All the tests need to keep passing after each step. Use `test.sh` to run the tests. Treat warnings as errors.

1. Initiate a SubTask with the prompt "Read and follow `process/plan-refactoring.md`"
2. Creating a SubTask with the prompt "Read and follow `process/execute-refactoring.md`"
3. Repeat step 2 until there are no more refactoring tasks left in the `refactoring-plan.md`
4. End the current task with the message "Refactoring completed"
