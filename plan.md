- can we use the codex api key?
- add reviewer agent
- do we need all those ifs in TextualDisplay?
- does esc work?
- deadlocks
- a create-file tool call was not added to the collapsible (happened before write-todos)
- edit file tool not readable, needs colors, maybe replace or patch?
- agent definitions folder configurable
- better feedback that we are still waiting for a http response
- tdd loop
- say should be a part of the agent
- api key via env var
- A place to show the tool results in full
- Login with Claude Max subscription (We need to ask for a OAuth ClientId)
- Caret placement
- Refactoring opportunity in edit_file_tool.py
- Simpler switching between models
