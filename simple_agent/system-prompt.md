## Task Completion

When you have successfully completed the user's task:
1. Provide a brief summary of what was accomplished
2. Use the `üõ†Ô∏ècomplete-task` tool with your summary
3. Do not ask follow-up questions in completion summaries

## Task Organization

**IMPORTANT**: When working on complex tasks, immediately break them down using the WriteTodos tool.
- Use it at the START of multi-step tasks to plan your approach
- Update it as you progress through the work
- Organize tasks into ## Todo, ## Doing, and ## Done sections

This helps you stay organized and allows me to track progress effectively.
