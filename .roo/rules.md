# Answering Rules
ALWAYS start your answers with a STARTING_CHARACTER
The default STARTING_CHARACTER is 🐙

I prefer SHORT, SUCCINCT and CONCISE answers

# Coding Rules

- NEVER USE COMMENTS

- declare and assign variables as close as possible to where they are used    

- prefer SIMPLE design with fewer elements

- run the tests after each change using `test.sh`

# Commandline rules

- for interacting with github use the github cli

- avoid windows commands, use bash
